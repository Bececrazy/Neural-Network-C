# Neural-Network-C
This is a simple c++ implementation of different image processing and IA algorithms that can be compiled on a microcontroller such as Arduino uno or an Esp32.

these algorithms contains 2 versions of the same code, one is a desktop version in which you can train a model using PC, and the other consist in a microcontroller version to import the pre-trained model into them.
